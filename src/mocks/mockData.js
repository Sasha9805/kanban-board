		body: 'Stacked on #32578.\r\n\r\nWe need to apply view-transition-names to the clones that we create in the "old" phase for the ViewTransition boundaries that should activate.\r\n\r\nFinding pairs is a little trickier than in ReactFiberCommitViewTransitions. Normally we collect all name "insertions" in the `accumulateSuspenseyCommit` phase before we even commit. Then in the snapshot do we visit all "deletions" and since we already collected all the insertions we know immediately if the deletion had a pair and should therefore get a "name" assigned to activate the boundary. For ReactFiberApplyGesture we need to assign names to "insertions" since it\'s in reverse but we don\'t already have a map of deletions. Therefore we need to first visit all deletions.\r\n\r\nInstead of doing that in a completely separate pass, we instead visit deletions in the same pass to find pairs. Since this is in the same pass we might visit insertions before deletions or vice versa depending on document order. However, we can deal with this by applying the name to the insertion when we find the deletion if we\'ve already made the clones at that point.\r\n\r\nApplying names to pure exits, updates or nested (relayout) is a bit more straight-forward.',

		body: "\nThis change fixes a coverage hole in rolling out with `gating`. Prior to this PR, configuring `gating` causes React Compiler to bail out of optimizing some functions.\n\nThis means that it's not entirely safe to cutover from `gating` enabled for all users (i.e. rolled out 100%) to removing the `gating` config altogether, as new functions may be opted into compilation (as they stop bailing out due to gating-specific logic).\n\nThis is technically slightly slower due to the additional function indirection + argument spreads / parameter rest elements. An alternative approach is to recommend running a codemod before removing the`gating` config.\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).
